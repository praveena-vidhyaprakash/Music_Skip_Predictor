# Music Skip Predictor

A Python-based machine learning application that predicts whether a song will be skipped or played based on its audio features and metadata.

## Features
- Predicts "skip" behavior using a trained ML model.
- Beginner-friendly interface (CLI or web-based).
- Includes both model training and inference scripts.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/praveena-vidhyaprakash/Music_Skip_Predictor.git
   cd Music_Skip_Predictor
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   If it's web-based, open your browser at the local server URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`) to interact.

2. **Train the model** (optional):

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
